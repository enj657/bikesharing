## Overview of Project

We need to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. We will analyse Citibike data to create a story that we can use for a new bike business in Des Moines.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to create a set of visualizations to show: the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results

We analysed the length of time that bikes were checked out for all riders and genders. The most common checkout time for all users was 5 minutes, and 5 minutes for males, 6 minutes for females, and 11 minutes for unknown gender.

We then visualized the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week. We saw that the most common checkout times are 8am in the morning and 5pm in the evening. Also, more bikes were used on Thursdays than any other day. We can also see that males had more trips than females and unknown gender.

An additional analysis included in our story in a bar chart showing the peak usage hours in August. From this chart we can see that 5pm is the peak hour.

I also included two maps: one showing the top starting locations and the other showing the top ending locations. From these maps we can see that the top starting and ending station was Pershing Square North.

In addition, I made a visualization showing the directions people traveled from their starting locations. This graph shows that most people rode either NE or SW and it also shows the distance people traveled.

## Summary

From our analyses we noticed many important things that will help solidify our business proposal that our bike sharing project will also work in Des Moines. Most people ride for approximately 5 minutes on average. Most bikes are used at 8am in the morning and 5pm in the evening, and Thursday are the most common day. Also, males checked out bikes more than females and unknown gender. The top starting and ending location was Pershing Square North, which is also Grand Central Station. It is centrally located and highly populated. I already added one "future" visualization, which showed the directions people travled from their starting locations. An additional visualization we can make is to group the number of trips people take by their ages and compare age groups.
